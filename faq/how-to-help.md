# How can I help with the development of the Common Impact Data Standard?

The Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) is fundamentally a community-driven initiative. Its ongoing development relies on the collaboration and feedback of a diverse group of impact measurement practitioners, academics, social purpose organizations, and software developers.

As a developer, your expertise is invaluable to the standard's continued evolution and relevance. We invite developers to contribute by participating in our technical committees and other consultations. Your feedback helps ensure the standard remains practical, robust, and aligned with the needs of the technology ecosystem.

We also welcome your implementation questions. The Common Approach team works directly with software providers and internal technical teams to support the alignment process. If you are exploring an implementation or have questions, please contact us.

You can reach the team at __info@commonapproach.org__.
