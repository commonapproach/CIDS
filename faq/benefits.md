# What are the benefits of using the Common Impact Data Standard?

For a software developer, adopting the __Common Impact Data Standard__ (__CIDS__) is about building a more powerful, interoperable, and future-proof application. It allows you to deliver significant value to your customers—both social purpose organizations (SPOs) and funders—by solving their biggest data sharing and analysis challenges.

## Benefits for Social Purpose Organizations (SPOs) and Funders/Investors

* __Reduced Reporting Burden__: This is the most significant advantage for SPOs. Instead of manually reformatting data for every funder's unique portal, they can use aligned software to export a standardized file. If funders adopt the Data Standard, this "report once, share many ways" approach can drastically cut down the administrative overhead for SPOs.
* __Meaningful, Comparable Data__: For funders, CIDS provides a way to aggregate data from across their portfolio without forcing every SPO to use the exact same metrics. Because the data is structured and semantically defined, it can be combined and compared in a meaningful way, leading to higher-quality analysis and better insights.
* __Empowered and Autonomous SPOs__: CIDS enables SPOs to measure what is most relevant to their mission and stakeholders, using the models they prefer. The data they collect for funders is also inherently useful for their own internal decision-making, leading to a virtuous cycle of better data and better outcomes.

## Benefits for Software Developers
By aligning with CIDS, you can focus your resources on what makes your application unique, rather than on data wrangling.

* __Focus on Features, Not Plumbing__: CIDS provides a rich, pre-built data model that handles the complexity of impact data. This means you can spend less time on creating and maintaining custom data importers, exporters, and transformation logic, and more time building the innovative features, analytics, and user experiences that differentiate your product.
* __Unlock True Interoperability__: A CIDS-aligned application is not a data silo. It can seamlessly import and export data with other aligned software and data utilities. This interoperability is a powerful selling point, as it gives customers flexibility and ensures they truly own their data.
* __Build a Future-Ready Architecture__: RDF is the language of modern knowledge graphs. Building on CIDS means your software's architecture is inherently prepared for the next wave of data analytics. You gain the ability to leverage powerful graph queries (SPARQL), logical inference (OWL), and sophisticated analysis that can be enhanced with AI and Large Language Models.
