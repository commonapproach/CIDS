# I'm not a programmer - how do I use the Common Impact Data Standard?

You don't need to be a programmer to use the Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS). In fact, most users will never see or interact with the standard directly.

Think of the Data Standard as a set of rules and definitions that works "behind the scenes" inside impact measurement software. It's designed to be embedded in the tools you already use, like spreadsheets or data platforms.

To "use" the Data Standard, you simply choose [an aligned software or data utility](https://www.commonapproach.org/common-impact-data-standard/) to record your impact information. The tool handles all the technical details for you. When you export or share your data, it is automatically structured in the standardized format, making it easier to share with funders and partners.

You do not need to learn any code or technical details to benefit from the standard.

For more non-technical guides and to learn more about the vision of flexible, shareable impact measurement, please visit the [Common Approach to Impact Measurement website](https://www.commonapproach.org/common-impact-data-standard/) and look for the link to the non-technical overview and introductory guide.
